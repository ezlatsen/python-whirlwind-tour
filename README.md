# python-whirlwind-tour

A whirlwind tour of the Python programming language inspired by "Crash into Python" by Stephen Sugden. https://stephensugden.com/crash_into_python/

## Overview

This repo contains a set of documents, slides, and labs that are meant to be used as a teaching aid for bringing programmers from other languages up to speed with Python. It assumes that you have enough familiarity with programming to know what function and class mean, and generally know how to code in one language or another. 

More importantly, it assumes that you either have an instructor who is well-versed in Python, or are resourceful enough to find answers for yourself. A number of these slides are designed to trigger questions and discussion, so if it seems like you're missing something, that's a good sign you could be digging deeper.

This tour will not prepare you to build large or complex Python applications. It will give you just enough information to make learning the rest of the language easier, and hopefully make you productive enough to write simple scripts.

## Learning Objectives

*	Install a distribution of Python 2.7x or 3.5x
*	Manage virtual-environments
*	Manage 3rd party modules
*	Create basic Python scripts
*	Create simple (but modular) Python programs
*	Create distributable Python packages

## Topics

* __Python syntax__ - The general form of Python code.
* __Code organization__ - The ways in which Python code can be accessed across files.
* __Functional programming features__ - Language features that support functional program design. Includes closures, decorators, lambdas and generators.
* __Object Oriented features__ - Language features that support OO program design. Includes classes, inheritance, abstract base classes and mixins. 
  * __Protocols__ - An introduction to a few of the "magic-methods" that you can implement to allow the Python runtime and standard library to treat your objects like the built-in types.

## Prerequisites

Intermediate level programming experience (in any language) is required. At a minimum you should have a high level understanding of object-oriented programming, and be able to create and use the following with little or no assistance:

*	Variables
*	Data types (integer, float, string)
*	Data structures (arrays, hashes, lists, etc.)
*	Loops (while, for)
*	User defined functions
*	Flow control (if…elif…else)
*	Logical operators (and,or,not)
